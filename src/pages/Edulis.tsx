                    Over a 12-week engagement, I helped Edulis Labs, a venture-backed biotech startup developing non-toxic hair color technology,
                    define a human-centered launch strategy for a revolutionary, health-conscious blonding treatment. The project combined industry
                    research, user interviews, and service design to identify high-opportunity salon segments and create a compelling brand narrative.

                        Edulis Labs faced the challenge of introducing a novel, safer blonding technology into a salon ecosystem controlled by long-standing
                        incumbents of an industry that has seen little innovation in the last century. They needed a go-to-market approach that would resonate
                        with professionals and consumers alike, building trust, awareness, and demand.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-4xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#001d36]">Introduction</h2>
                    <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        In Spring 2025, my team and I developed a comprehensive go-to-market strategy for Edulis Labs, a venture-backed biotech startup developing
                        safer, science-driven alternatives to conventional hair color and bleach products. Founded by a PhD chemist and backed by leading investors
                        and industry veterans, Edulis seeks to disrupt the $23 billion global hair color industry with a molecular blonding system that eliminates
                        toxicity and protects human health.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        My team and I applied a rigorous, insight-driven approach to craft an actionable strategy for Edulis’ launch in Los Angeles. Over 12 weeks, we
                        conducted competitive and industry analyses, built behavioral segmentation models, and synthesized deep insights from interviews with colorists,
                        salon owners, and end-users.

                        Our work culminated in a multi-dimensional strategy that included:
                        <li>Customer segmentation and value propositions based on unmet needs</li>
                        <li>A redesigned in-salon service experience tailored to Edulis’ unique technical process</li>
                        <li>Brand positioning and messaging rooted in customer language and health values</li>
                        <li>A detailed LA launch playbook with metrics for adoption and growth</li>

                    To build a GTM strategy for Edulis, we began with an in-depth analysis of the hair color industry. We mapped the competitive landscape,
                    assessed market dynamics, and analyzed key distribution channels to identify leverage points in an entrenched, brand-loyal ecosystem.
                </p>

                    After our initial scan of what the industry looked like, it was time for us to talk to all personnel within the hair ecosystem, which included end-users,
                    colorists, scientists, and salon owners. <strong> We quickly realized that the people who have power to make decisions on what products to adopt were the colorists.
                        We narrowed down our focus of conversations to colorists, and we learned that many colorists’ brand loyalties are formed early.</strong> Our primary research
                    lead us to cosmetology schools as a powerful yet underutilized channel for product influence.

                </p>
                <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We conducted interviews and research focused on data with professionals and salon students, surfacing critical insights:

                    <li>Initial product exposure at cosmetology school often dictates long-term brand allegiance</li>
                    <li>Many instructors use outdated materials, and health & safety knowledge gaps are widespread</li>
                    <li>61% of students fail the PSI exam, despite health-related content comprising 25% of the exam</li>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We proposed Edulis position itself not only as a product innovator, but <strong> as an educator that would partner with schools, offer training workshops,
                        and even develop a certification or curriculum to build credibility and early loyalty.</strong>
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    When presenting our research to Edulis’ founding team, we were told to focus on prroducing strategies that were more short-term and could have
                    immediate impact. Recognizing the importance of iterating, we went back to the drawing board and again talked to more people.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl text-center font-semibold mb-4 text-[#001d36]">Iterate!</h3>
                <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    While we put the proposed Edulis school in the back-pocket, we were still extremely captivated by the idea of education and how stylists are influenced. Talking to
                    more than 15 stylists, we realized that more than 80% of stylists are not static in brand choice as we once thought. <strong>A key insight we learned was the salon industry
                        is competitive, and stylists often continue to learn and evolve to stay current with the trends and diverse customers’ needs. </strong> One stylist said the technical knowledge
                    she gained from her cosmetology school only consisted of 30% of her total knowledge now.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed">
                    We developed three early brand concepts under the theme of continuous education for stylists each exploring different channels:
                    <li>Edulis x Exhibits: A pop-up experience at beauty and tech conventions to demystify the science behind Edulis.                    </li>
                    <li>Edulis x Angela: A partnership with a trusted beauty influencer to bridge stylist and client communities.                    </li>
                    <li>Edulis x The Runway: A fashion-forward brand moment showcasing the product’s vibrancy on high-profile models, aimed at elite stylists.
                    </li>

                    With these three broad potential ideas, our ideation process included a range of brainstorming techniques, “how might we” reframing,
                    and visual moodboards to ensure each concept responded directly to user insights.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We began with a loose framework and invited colorists to co-create the details, drawing on their past experiences with brands. We asked them
                    to reflect on what had worked well, what had fallen short, and what they wished they could try. Central to every conversation was a shared desire
                    for trust and authenticity. Over time, our insights converged on a recurring theme: <strong>the most compelling path to adoption was a close, education-focused
                        relationship between brand representatives and salons, built not on sales, but on shared knowledge and professional respect.</strong>
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The final concept was the Revolutionized Rep Program, which reimagines the traditional sales rep model into an education-first,
                    relationship-based strategy that centers stylist empowerment. Rather than pitching products, Edulis Reps act as trusted educators:
                    experienced stylists who train their peers directly in-salon, demonstrating Edulis’ health-first chemistry through hands-on workshops.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This solution was developed through iterative prototyping and direct outreach to over a dozen salons and colorists. Feedback consistently
                    revealed a desire for authentic, informative engagement over transactional sales. Our design centers on the insight that belief in Edulis must
                    come before adoption, and belief is built through credible, peer-led learning.

                    We developed three early brand concepts under the theme of continuous education for stylists each exploring different channels:
                    <li>Rep Recruitment & Training: Targeting values-aligned, charismatic stylists to serve as the face of Edulis. Training includes product knowledge, teaching pedagogy, and relationship-building.
                    </li>
                    <li>Salon Targeting: We identified 50–100 LA salons most aligned with Edulis’ mission—especially in West Hollywood, Santa Monica, and Beverly Hills—using Instagram DMs and interviews to gauge interest.
                    </li>
                    <li>Event Format: Two-hour low-pressure workshops featuring product demos, model applications, Q&As, and incentives (e.g., free product, stylist points system).
                    </li>
                    <li> Incentives: A loyalty point system encourages salons to engage with workshops, promote Edulis, and build ongoing relationships.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg font-beezee text-[#001d36] leading-relaxed">We also mapped risks and mitigations, including cost containment strategies (starting with part-time reps), scaling cautiously, and refining workshop formats based on stylist feedback.
                    Our Launch Playbook offers a tactical roadmap for Edulis to pilot and scale the Revolutionized Rep Program across LA, supported by clear brand messaging, social media integration, and feedback loops. It’s a solution rooted in humility, education, and the real behaviors of stylists who care deeply about their craft.
